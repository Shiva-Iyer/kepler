Introduction
------------

This is the kepler library, version 1.0.0.

kepler provides a set of functions for performing astronomical calculations. The
intent is to provide the basic building blocks necessary for more sophisticated
applications. Consequently, no attempt has been made to provide an user interface
or to write programs that meet various needs (observation, historical research
etc.).

The kepler library is free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.

Installation
------------

kepler is written in ANSI C and has been tested under Linux with the following
build tools:

      * GNU gcc 	4.4.1
      * GNU Make	3.81

Running `make' in the `src' subdirectory will compile all the library files and
example programs. In order to call kepler's functions from your own applications,
you will need to customize the file `makefile' or create your own.

Examples
--------

The following sample programs may be found in the `src' subdirectory.

kepler_test.c calls most of the functions in kepler and displays the results in a
terminal window. To test the routines in mpc_file.c, you must download the MPC
Orbit Database files from <http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/MPCORB.html>.

rise_set.c is a program that accepts some command line arguments and displays
the rise, upper transit and set times for the Sun, Moon, planets and Pluto.
No corrections are made for planetary aberration, nutation, geocentric parallax or
for the motion of the swifter objects (Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars). Consequently,
the displayed times could be anywhere between 3 and 6 minutes in error.

Documentation
-------------

The names of the C source and header files are self-explanatory and indicate
the nature of the functions contained therein. Extensive comments in the
source code describe function parameters, return values and other relevant
information.

References
----------

kepler is targeted towards users with a sound grasp of positional astronomy.
However, it has been thought fit to include references to the relevant
astronomical literature in the source code.

No work of this nature would be possible without the following standard works on
astronomical algorithms:

  * Explanatory supplement to the Astronomical Almanac by P. Kenneth Seidelmann
  * Astronomical Algorithms by Jean Meeus

Bugs
----

Comments, criticisms and bug reports are very welcome and may be sent to the
kepler maintainer.
